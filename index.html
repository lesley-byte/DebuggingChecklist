    <h1>JavaScript Debugging Process Checklist</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Debugging is an essential aspect of software development. The process involves identifying and resolving bugs
            or defects in software to ensure it performs as expected. This checklist guides you through a systematic
            approach to debugging JavaScript code, helping you understand and implement each step effectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="full_code" name="full_code">
        <label for="full_code">Start with the full code. Begin your debugging process by understanding the entire scope
            of the script, focusing on the sections that are manifesting the problem. This initial assessment is crucial
            for pinpointing the areas that require detailed investigation.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="simplify_code" name="simplify_code">
        <label for="simplify_code">Simplify the code to a minimal example using static values. Strip down the code to
            its basic elements, removing any complexity that isn't directly related to the issue. Use static data to
            replace dynamic inputs, which helps in isolating the error by removing external dependencies.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="add_logging" name="add_logging">
        <label for="add_logging">Add logging statements to trace values at critical points. Insert console.log()
            statements before and after significant operations or where variables are manipulated. This will help you
            track the flow of data and the behavior of the application at these critical junctures.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="reintroduce_complexity" name="reintroduce_complexity">
        <label for="reintroduce_complexity">Incrementally reintroduce complexity. Gradually add back previously removed
            elements or complexity, testing the functionality after each addition. This step-by-step approach allows you
            to identify the exact component that causes the fault when reintroduced.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="test_addition" name="test_addition">
        <label for="test_addition">Test after each addition to ensure the system functions correctly. Employ both
            automated and manual testing techniques to cover various scenarios and uses of your code. Document the
            outcomes to analyze later if needed.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="observe_logs" name="observe_logs">
        <label for="observe_logs">Observe logs and identify when errors occur. Pay close attention to the output in your
            logs to detect any anomalies or unexpected behaviors. This step is crucial for understanding the
            circumstances under which the errors manifest.</label>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <input type="checkbox" id="resolve_issue" name="resolve_issue">
        <label for="resolve_issue">Resolve the issue when identified. Adjust or rewrite the problematic sections of your
            code based on the insights gained from your logs and testing. Ensure the fix resolves the bug without
            introducing new issues to other parts of the system.</label>
